This is the code that runs wny.news. I wanted a small simple site where I could look at some headlines from around the area.

I also wanted to learn something about how to do some web scraping. 

Most importantly, I didn't want to spend much time or money on this thing.

You don't want to use this code for anything, it's just something I'm doing to learn and for fun.

The code is a mess, not meant to be perfect or used by anyone else.
